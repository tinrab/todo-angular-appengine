## Build

Replace `[CLIENT_ID]` with your own Google client ID inside `server/app.yaml`, `src/environments/environment.ts` and `src/environments/environment.prod.ts`.

Run the following commands to build and deploy.

```
export PROJECT_ID=[PROJECT_ID]
npm run build && npm run deploy
```

Replace `[PROJECT_ID]` with your Google API Console project ID.

Finally, navigate to `https://[PROJECT_ID].appspot.com`.
